# Scala Examples

I thought that it would be a good idea that while I learn Scala, I also try and learn how to write tests for 
the example code. Most of the code is not named the same as in the book to avoid conflicts. 

## Where do the examples come from?

* [Programming Scala](https://pragprog.com/book/vsscala/programming-scala)
* [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) Chapter 5: Scala

## References

Just some handy links of things used to help me learn Scala:

* [The first video I saw on Scala that made me want to try it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH75sJAR0hc) Thanks Venkat Subramaniam
* [Scala for the Intrigued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grvvKURwGNg)

# Dependencies

* [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) Super handy Scala Build tool
* [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_spec) Mainly FunSpec
 
 
## autotesting
 In terminal 
 
``` 
 sbt
```
 
follow it with: 

```
~ test
```
